    """This function will update the affected variables of all receiver
    components due to an interaction. This is done by constructing
    global fields by interpolating the dependent variables of all
    suppliers onto grids.
    The supplied 'dependent' argument is thus a list of variables which
    should be interpolated to the grid. For details on the structure
    of this argument, see the CIC_components2domain_grid function
    in the mesh module, where the corresponding argument is called
    quantities.

    Two global grids are used, œÜ_particles and œÜ_fluids, both of which
    contain the entire density/potential field of both particle and
    fluid components. For œÜ_fluids, a CIC deconvolution will take place
    on the contribution from particles only, corresponding to the
    interpolation from particles onto the grid. For œÜ_particles, this
    same deconvolution will take place, but in addition both the
    particle and fluid contribution will be deconvolved once more,
    corresponding to the interpolation from the grid back to
    the particles.

    The deconvolutions take place in Fourier space. Also while in
    Fourier space, the grids are transformed to the (Fourier
    transformed) potential by multiplying each grid point by
    potential(k2), where k2 = k¬≤ is the squared magnitude of the wave
    vector at the given grid point. For further details on the potential
    argument, see the construct_potential function.

    The grids are then Fourier transformed back to real space and
    differentiated along each dimension to get the force.

    """This function populate two grids (including pseudo points and
    ghost layers) with a real-space potential corresponding to the
    Fourier-space potential function given, due to all supplier
    components. A seperate grid for particle and fluid components will
    be constructed, the difference being only the handling of
    deconvolutions needed for the interpolation to/from the grid.
    Both grids will contain the potential due to all the components.
    Which variables to extrapolate to the grid is determined by the
    quantities argument. For details on this argument, see the
    CIC_components2domain_grid function in the mesh module.

    First the variables given in 'quantities' of the components are
    interpolated to the grids; particle components to one grid and
    fluid components to a seperate grid. The two grids are then Fourier
    transformed.
    The potential function is then used to change the value of each grid
    point for both grids. Also while in Fourier space, deconvolutions
    will be carried out, in a different manner for each grid.
    The two grids are added in such a way that they both corresponds to
    the total potential of all components, but deconvolved in the way
    suitable for either particles or fluids. Note that if a fluid
    component have a gridsize different from œÜ_gridsize, interpolation
    will take place but no deconvolution will be made, leading to
    errors on small scales.
    The two grids are now Fourier transformed back to real space.

    In the case of normal gravity, we have
    œÜ(k) = -4œÄGa¬≤œÅ(k)/k¬≤ = -4œÄG a**(-3*w_eff - 1) œ±(k)/k¬≤,
    which can be signalled by passing
    quantities = [('particles', a**(-3*w_eff - 1)*mass/Vcell),
                  ('œ±', a**(-3*w_eff - 1))],
    potential = lambda k2: -4*œÄ*G_Newton/k2
    (note that it is not actally allowed to pass an untyped lambda
    function in compiled mode).
